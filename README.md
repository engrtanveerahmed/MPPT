# Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)

## Introduction
We know that sun light is varriable during day some time is low some time it's intensity is high specially at mid of day its intensity is high due to this our solar pannel gives varriable voltages we intensity is high our normal solar pannel 12 voltes rated  gives 14or 15 voltages and if it is connected to 12v rated bettery this extra voltages is really hazerd for our bettry in ordr to remove this hazerd we design Maximun power point trackin solar charge controller (MPPT).

## Design requirements
In todays world design in project play inportant it requires to main key parameters one is we can carry it any where easily number two it is eye catching, in order to do we made design on autocade and also we are blessed with fablab that contain 3D printer with help of that we made our 3D design.

## Project excuting plan
We have distribute our task in to two member so that beacause in short time we have alot of work to do bellow chart contain our flow of doing work.
